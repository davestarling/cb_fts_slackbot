# cb_fts_slackbot
Couchbase Full-Text Search Slackbot

Will expand on this README shortly, but for now you can just chmod a+x bot.py, then run:

./boy -e development -s "{your Slack Bot User's API token}"

You will also need to create the FTS indexes in Couchbase using the JSON definitions in fts_indexes
